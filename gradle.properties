# Gradle JVM Arguments
# Keep CDS sharing enabled for performance optimization

# JVM configuration with CDS sharing enabled
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

# Note: The CDS warning is harmless and indicates that sharing is working but limited
# due to Gradle's bootstrap classpath modifications. This is expected behavior.
