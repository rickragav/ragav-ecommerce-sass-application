# Product Composite Service

A fully-implemented microservice that provides a comprehensive view by combining product data and reviews in a single API response for the Ragav E-commerce SaaS Application.

## 🚀 **Status: ENHANCED (Week 2)**

## 🎯 **Purpose**
The Product Composite Service implements the **API Composition pattern** to:
- Combine product information with its reviews
- Provide a single endpoint for comprehensive product data
- Reduce client-side complexity and network calls
- Improve user experience with faster data loading

## ✅ **Implemented Features**

### **API Endpoints**
- `GET /product-composite/{productId}` - Get product with all reviews (Enhanced with complete product data)
- `POST /product-composite` - **NEW**: Create composite product with reviews in single operation
- `DELETE /product-composite/{productId}` - Delete product and all reviews
- `GET /actuator/health` - Health check endpoint

### **Week 2 Enhancements**
- ✅ **Full CRUD Support**: Added complete CREATE operation for composite products
- ✅ **Enhanced Data Model**: Extended ProductAggregate with price, stock, status, images
- ✅ **Automatic Review Creation**: Creates product and associated reviews in single transaction
- ✅ **Complete Product Attributes**: Support for pricing, inventory, tenant isolation, multiple image sizes
- ✅ **Improved Constructor Injection**: Cleaner dependency injection without @Autowired
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced exception management for composite operations

### **Service Integration**
- ✅ **Product Service Integration**: Retrieves product data from product-service:8080
- ✅ **Review Service Integration**: Fetches all reviews from review-service:8081
- ✅ **Data Aggregation**: Combines product and review data into single response
- ✅ **Error Propagation**: Properly handles and forwards errors from upstream services
- ✅ **Exception Handling**: Unified error responses (404, 422) across all endpoints

### **Enhanced Data Model (Week 2)**
- ✅ **ProductAggregate Extended**: Added price, stockQuantity, status, tenantId
- ✅ **Multiple Image Support**: Small, medium, large image URL support
- ✅ **Flexible User Handling**: Nullable userId support in Review model
- ✅ **Comprehensive toString()**: Better debugging and logging capabilities
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper null handling throughout data models

### **Technical Implementation**
- ✅ **Spring Boot 3.3.4**: Latest stable framework with reactive architecture
- ✅ **Java 17**: LTS version with modern language features
- ✅ **WebFlux Stack**: Pure reactive implementation for high performance
- ✅ **RestTemplate**: HTTP client for service-to-service communication
- ✅ **Port 8082**: Dedicated port for composite service
- ✅ **Shared Dependencies**: Uses `api` and `utils` modules
- ✅ **Docker Support**: Multi-stage build with health checks
- ✅ **Centralized Logging**: File-based logging with volume persistence

```

### **Data Flow**
```
```

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Java 17 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Product Service running on port 8080  
- Review Service running on port 8081

### **Running the Service**

#### **Docker Compose (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start all services including dependencies
docker-compose up -d

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8082/actuator/health
```

#### **Development Mode**
```bash
# Build the service
./gradlew :product-composite-service:build

# Run locally (requires other services to be running)
./gradlew :product-composite-service:bootRun
```

### **Testing the Service**
```bash
# Get product with reviews
curl http://localhost:8082/product-composite/1

# Create a product (delegates to product service)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/product-composite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productId": 123, "name": "Test Product", "weight": 100}'

# Test with non-existent product (should return 404)
curl http://localhost:8082/product-composite/999
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

The service is included in the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
# Run all microservice tests (includes composite service testing)
./test-microservices-api.sh
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- ✅ Health check validation
- ✅ Successful product aggregation  
- ✅ Non-existent product handling (404 response)
- ✅ Multi-review aggregation (10+ reviews per product)
- ✅ Service integration validation
- ✅ Error propagation from upstream services

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Application Properties**
```yaml
server:
  port: 8082

app:
  product-service:
    host: product
    port: 8080
  review-service:
    host: review  
    port: 8080
```

### **Docker Configuration**
```yaml
product-composite:
  build: product-composite-service
  mem_limit: 512m
  ports:
    - "8082:8080"
  environment:
    - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker
```

## 🌟 **Key Benefits**

- **Reduced Network Calls**: Single API call instead of multiple client-side requests
- **Improved Performance**: Server-side aggregation reduces client processing
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Unified error responses across all operations  
- **Reactive Architecture**: High-performance async processing with WebFlux
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing and Docker deployment support
```

### **Response Structure**
```json
{
  "productId": 1,
  "name": "Test Product",
  "reviews": [
    {
      "reviewId": "rev1",
      "user": "user",
      "reviewTitle": "Great Product",
      "reviewContent": "This is an excellent product!",
      "rating": 5
    }
  ],
  "serviceAddresses": {
    "productCatalogService": "container/ip:port",
    "productService": "container/ip:port", 
    "reviewService": "container/ip:port"
  }
}
              → [ProductClient + ReviewClient] (parallel calls)
              → Combine responses
              → Return comprehensive product view
```

## 🔧 **Build**

This service is built automatically as part of the root project:

```bash
./gradlew buildAll
```

## 🔄 **Recent Changes (September 2025)**
